I am Anna Gabriella Tóth, currently an undergraduate Psychology student at ELTE. I joined the  ELTE Stress & Emotions Lab in 2025, where I gain insight into the process of psychological research and assist in stress-related studies. I also aim to write my own research on the impact of stress and anxiety on academic and social performance. I am also pursuing an International Relations BA, where I study culture-related nonverbal body language.
