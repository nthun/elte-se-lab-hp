I graduated from ELTE with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 2022, after which I continued my studies at the Master's degree in clinical and health psychology. After completing my Master's degree, I would like to continue my studies at the Faculty of Medicine, because I firmly believe that the health of a person requires the combined integrity of both the body and the soul, and by completing these courses I could satisfy my idea of what ‘healing’ is. I applied for the research group because I believe that it is crucial to understand stress, as it has many negative effects on our health. I also wanted to get an insight into how to execute a research project from start to finish. It was important for me to be part of a research team that was also involved in psychophysiological measurements. In addition to university and the research group, I am currently training as a CBT consultant and on courses in family and couples therapy.
