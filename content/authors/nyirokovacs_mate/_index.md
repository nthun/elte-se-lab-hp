My name is Máté Nyírő-Kovács, and I am a first-year Bachelor's student in Psychology at ELTE. I joined the lab in 2025 as a research assistant with the intention of gaining hands-on experience across all aspects of research. While I haven't yet chosen a particular focus, I look forward to exploring different topics and finding what excites me specifically within the field. In the future I hope to work on understanding complex emotions.
