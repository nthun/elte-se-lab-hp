Hello! Joining the Stress and Emotions Lab as a PhD student in September 2023 marked a significant step in my academic path, which began with a BA in Psychology from Pazmany Peter University. I furthered my expertise with a Master's in Cognitive Psychology from ELTE and then shifted focus and earned an MA in Quantitative Methods from the University of Texas at Austin. Since 2019, I have been teaching statistics and data analysis to undergraduate and graduate students. My current PhD research delves into the dynamics of time perception under stress.
