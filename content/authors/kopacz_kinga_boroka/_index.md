I am Kinga Boróka Kopacz. I completed the master's program in Clinical and Health Psychology at ELTE in 2023. Before that, I obtained a bachelor's degree at Babeș-Bolyai University in Transylvania, and I also studied for one semester at the University of Würzburg in Germany. During my MA studies, I worked as a research assistant at the ELTE S&E Lab, where I participated in the Media-Induced Stress Recovery Project. Within this project, I focused on attentional focus and emotion regulation. My main professional interests include emotion regulation, stress, and various adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies. Additionally, I am interested in action-based, outdoor therapeutic methods and their mechanisms. Currently, I am completing my postgraduate professional practice in this perspective, working with populations characterized by atypical development or vulnerable social backgrounds.
