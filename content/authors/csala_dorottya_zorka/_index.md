I am Dorottya Zorka Csala, a first year Bachelor’s Student in Psychology at ELTE. I joined the research lab in April 2025. I aim to familiarise myself with the research process itself and gain valuable knowledge of various research methodologies. I am particularly interested in clinical psychology therefore I aspire to deepen my knowledge how the physiological factors affect psychological states and how different stressful life events shape affective decision-making including changes in eating habits, prioritization or attentional focus.
