I'm Flóra Janku, a second-year Master's student in Psychology at ELTE PPK, where I am studying Clinical and Health Psychology. In the future I would like to work in the clinical field with a cognitive and schema therapy approach, and I am also interested in clinical research. I joined the Stress and Emotions research group as a research assistant in January 2023, while I was still in undergraduate studies. Here, I am working on the relationship between media-induced stress recovery and the menstrual cycle, as well as assisting in other projects. When I have more free time, I also volunteer at a psychiatric care centre. I enjoy being in nature, cooking and reading.
