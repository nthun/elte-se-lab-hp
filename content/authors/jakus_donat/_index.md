I am Donát Jakus, I graduated from ELTE with a BA in Psychology. I am a member of the research team since January 2023. What is really interesting to me is what kind of system we can find in the differences in behaviour between people. In the research group, I am working on a project on media-induced stress recovery. Within that, I am researching the role of specific emotions.
