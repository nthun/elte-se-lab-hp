I graduated as a psychologist from the University of Szeged in 2019. After graduation I became a PhD student at the BME Doctoral School of Psychology under Dr. Bertalan Polner, where I graduated in 2023. My main research interest is the mapping of within-person variation in healthy and pathological cognitive and affective functioning using intensive longitudinal data collection procedures and complex statistical models.
