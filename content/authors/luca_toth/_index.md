My name is Luca Tóth, and I am a first-year Bachelor’s student in Psychology at ELTE. I joined the lab in December 2025 to gain first-hand experience in research and to understand the methodological and practical aspects of scientific work. I am especially interested in psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms and how stress-related hormonal regulation influences emotional experience and long-term health outcomes.
