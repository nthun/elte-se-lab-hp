I am Mercédesz Tóth, currently a master’s student in psychology at ELTE, specializing in cognitive psychology. I joined the Stress & Emotions Lab in 2025, where I investigate the psychological correlates of caffeine sensitivity, with a focus on interoceptive awareness and sensory processing. My main area of interest is how somatic and neural processes shape subjective experience, including their role in neuropsychiatric disorders.
