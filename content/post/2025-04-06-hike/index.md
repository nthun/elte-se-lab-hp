title: "Spring recharge with a Zebegény hike"

In the beginning of April, lab members took on an adventure in Zebegény to relax and recharge as we prepare for the end of the semester.

The spring semester of 2025 started out strong. Our lab started three new research projects, worked on a number of publications and conference events - needless to say, we were not bored at all.

To take a relaxing break in nature, the lab decided to take a hike in the mountains of Zebegény. We started out with a delicious strudel at Zebegényi Rétesező, and carried on with a light hike, while talking work and non-work.

Despite a few of our members not being able to attend, we had a great time, and definitely recharged our batteries for the rest of the semester.
