Eötvös Loránd University created the University Excellence Fund (UEF) in 2022, in an attempt to bolster academic endeavors, foster research excellence, and provide a significant financial boost to selected projects. This year's funding cycle that mobilized the biggest sum of money, namely, a staggering HUF 125 million, was focused on young research groups at ELTE.

One of the notable winners in this funding initiative is Dr. Tamás Nagy, an adjunct professor at ELTE PPK, whose application for the funding secured ELTE Stress and Emotions Lab a coveted spot among the selected projects. The ELTE Stress and Emotions research group, to be established with the allocated funding, aims to unravel the intricate links between heightened physiological states — such as acute physiological stress — and human behavior, cognition, perception, and emotions.

The projects undertaken by the ELTE Stress and Emotions Lab will utilize experimental methods to explore the effects of physiological arousal in both controlled laboratory environments and everyday situations. The interdisciplinary approach adopted by the research group is poised to shed light on the complex interplay between the body and mind, offering insights into the investigation of human consciousness.

We, at Stress and Emotions Lab, are thankful for the opportunity given to us! We are eager to embark on our journey to delve deeper into our research projects and contribute to the understanding of the human mind and emotions.
