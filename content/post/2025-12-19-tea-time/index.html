<p>The Stress and Emotions Lab held their annual Christmas celebration on the 19th of December. After the succesful TDK presentations and a challenging semester behind, the celebration was well needed and deserved.</p>

<p>The lab members gathered in a special tea house in Budapest where they had the chance to taste special tea creations and talk through the latest events at the lab: the successful TDK presentations and the ongoing research projects. They also had the chance to connect and enjoy a lovely evening together before the start of the Christmas break.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas to everyone!</p>
