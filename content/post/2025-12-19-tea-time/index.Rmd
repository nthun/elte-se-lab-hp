The Stress and Emotions Lab held their annual Christmas celebration on the 19th of December. After the succesful TDK presentations and a challenging semester behind, the celebration was well needed and deserved.

The lab members gathered in a special tea house in Budapest where they had the chance to taste special tea creations and talk through the latest events at the lab: the successful TDK presentations and the ongoing research projects. They also had the chance to connect and enjoy a lovely evening together before the start of the Christmas break. 

Merry Christmas to everyone!
