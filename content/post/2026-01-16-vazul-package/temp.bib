  abstract = {Recent experience sampling research on affective functioning has emphasised the importance of short-term dynamics, yet rarely evaluates whether momentary measures are better explained by stable individual differences or by within-individual fluctuations. To address this issue, we (1) decomposed the variance in momentary affect explained by rumination across the between- and within-person levels, and (2) compared the predictive validity of state-based (mean state) and global (trait) self-report rumination measures of between-person differences. Our sample comprised 247 individuals who received eight questionnaires every day for up to 28 days, assessing their momentary affective states and emotion regulation, yielding 14,265 observations. Our results showed that rumination indices explained 2–3 times more variance in momentary negative affect at the between-individual level than at the within-individual …},

  journaltitle = {OSF},
  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by alterations in social understanding and self-related experience that overlap with broader dimensions of psychosocial vulnerability. These domains are tightly interconnected, motivating the use of analytic approaches that can capture their organization as complex associations rather than as isolated dimensions. We applied network analysis to individuals with autism (N= 156) and matched neurotypical controls (N= 454). Gaussian graphical models were estimated using sum scores of psychosocial constructs, and networks were compared using centrality metrics and the Network Comparison Test. Compared to neurotypical participants, individuals with ASD showed higher levels of psychosocial difficulties and lower global network strength. Mentalization emerged as a central node in both groups, while autistic traits were more central in the neurotypical network and trait anxiety showed relatively higher centrality in the ASD network. These findings suggest that psychosocial vulnerability in autism is characterized by a distinct and less integrated network organization, with mentalization playing a central organizing role across groups and anxiety exerting a relatively greater influence in ASD. Network-based approaches may therefore help identify mechanism-relevant targets for intervention and refine dimensional models of social and self-related functioning in autism.},
