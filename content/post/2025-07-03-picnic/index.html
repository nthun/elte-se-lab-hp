<p>This semester brought many challenges and required hard work from everyone in the Lab. After the end of the semester and the SIPS conference 2025, in which most of the lab members participated as it was held in Budapest, the members decided to celebrate with a picnic at Városliget.</p>

<p>Everybody brought some food, and during the lovely brunch, we talked about the latest events and achievements. For example, Flóra received 1st place at the National Conference of Scientific Students’ Associations (OTDK) competition with her paper. Another member, Anna, also participated in the conference. Other members finished writing their doctoral theses or scientific articles and manuscripts. The Lab also welcomed new members this semester, and the picnic was a great opportunity for everyone to get to know each other better.</p>
<p>With so many great accomplishments, it was clear that a celebration was needed! We had a lovely time and felt ready to continue the work after the summer vacations.</p>
