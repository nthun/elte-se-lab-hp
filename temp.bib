  abstract = {Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental health issues in childhood, yet most children do not receive treatment. With recent advances in technology, a growing number of digital anxiety interventions are becoming accessible. This study is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of digital cognitive-behavioral anxiety interventions for individuals under the age of 18. Five electronic databases (PsycNET, Web of Science, Science Direct, Pub Med, SAGE Journals.) were systematically searched in 2021. Inclusion criteria were: randomized control trials with a wait list no treatment control, standalone to blended care with minimal therapist involvement, diagnosed anxiety disorder or elevated levels of anxiety, outcome anxiety levels had to be assessed by a clinician, or the patients themselves by a validated anxiety measure. We assessed and controlled for publication bias, and considered …},

Methods: We analyzed OUS data from the PSA, which was collected internationally on a centralized online questionnaire. We also collected qualitative feedback from experts for each translated version.

  journaltitle = {Journal of Neurophysiology},
  abstract = {Reactive inhibitory control plays an important role in phenotype of different diseases/different phases of a disease. One candidate electrophysiological marker of inhibitory control is frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA). FAA reflects the relative difference in contralateral frontal brain activity. However, the relationship between FAA and potential behavioral/brain activity indices of reactive inhibitory control is not yet clear. We assessed the relationship between resting-state FAA and indicators of reactive inhibitory control. Additionally, we investigated the effect of modulation of FAA via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We implemented a randomized sham-controlled design with 65 healthy humans (Mage = 23.93; SDage = 6.08; 46 female). Before and after 2 mA anodal tDCS of the right frontal site (with the cathode at the contralateral site) for 20 minutes, we collected EEG data and reactive inhibitory performance in …},

  journaltitle = {OSF},
  abstract = {Questionable research practices (QRPs) pose a significant threat to the integrity and credibility of scientific research. However, historically, they remain ill-defined and a comprehensive list of QRPs is lacking. The article addresses this concern by defining, collecting, and categorizing QRPs using an expert consensus method. Collaborators of the study agreed on the following definition:“Questionable research practices (QRPs) are ways of producing, maintaining, sharing, analyzing, or interpreting data that are likely to produce misleading conclusions, typically in the interest of the researcher. QRPs are not normally considered to include research practices that are prohibited or proscribed in the researcher’s field (eg, fraud, research misconduct). Neither do they include random/non-motivated researcher error (eg, accidental data loss).” Drawing from both iterative discussions and existing literature, we collected, defined and categorized 40 QRPs. We also considered attributes such as potential harms, detectability, clues, and remedies for each QRP. The results suggest that QRPs are pervasive and versatile, and have the potential to undermine all stages of the scientific enterprise. This work contributes to the maintenance of research integrity, transparency, and reliability by raising awareness for and improving the understanding of QRPs.},

  journaltitle = {PsyArXiv},
  abstract = {Schizotypy, a multidimensional personality construct with disorganization at its core, predicts future psychosis risk. Moreover, heightened stress-reactivity is associated with vulnerability to psychosis. It has been found that positive and negative schizotypal traits predict distress-induced psychotic-like experiences (PLE-reactivity) in everyday life. However, these findings require further investigation within individuals since the association of disorganization with stress-and PLE-reactivity in daily life was not assessed in previous studies. We conducted an experience sampling study where participants repeatedly reported their PLEs, perceived distress (pleasantness of a recent significant event), and exposure to stressors (eg, negative changes in salary, housing, health, and relationships). Schizotypal traits were assessed with the Multidimensional Schizotypy Scale-Brief (MSS-B). We obtained 3304 observations from 104 participants from the general population. Multilevel models were used to examine the interaction of schizotypal traits and stressor exposure in predicting PLEs and perceived distress. Our results indicated that individuals with higher disorganized (but not positive or negative) schizotypy experienced more intense distress-related PLEs in daily life. Moreover, individuals with higher disorganization experienced stressor exposure as more unpleasant. These findings mean that disorganization but not positive or negative schizotypy is a specific determinant of stress-related psychosis-like experiences and stress-appraisal in everyday life.

  journaltitle = {PsyArXiv},
  abstract = {Emotions and their flexible regulation are essential in adapting to our environment. Individuals differ significantly in their ability to regulate their emotions, and research has traditionally focused on these individual differences. However, evidence emerges that traditional laboratory measures and questionnaires capturing trait emotion regulation may not correspond to emotion regulation ability in real life as assessed by repeated measures designs. These processes appear to show different variability between and within individuals, implying that characteristics regarded as traits in psychology–eg, emotion regulation effectiveness and typical use of strategies–may not reflect everyday functioning. One of the most extensively researched emotion regulation strategies is rumination, a cognitive process that involves repeatedly and passively dwelling on negative feelings and their consequences. Interestingly, recent results suggest only a weak correlation between state and trait measures of rumination. Furthermore, evidence supports that increased state (but not trait) rumination is associated with higher emotional reactivity, the emotional reactions experienced in response to a negative occurrence. However, based on the evidence described above, the temporal, within-person examination of rumination may predict emotional reactivity even more accurately. The present study aims to confirm that within-person, state measures of rumination hold a more substantial predictive value for emotional reactivity compared to between-person trait rumination. We also investigated the association between state and trait rumination in this longitudinal study. The …},
